*mystery1 is of "extremely hard" difficulty.
*mystery3 is of "hard" difficulty.

How to know if sudoku is solvable?
a sudoku board is solvable if there exists a possibility where there
are no same digits on the same row, column and sub-board. If such
possibility does not exist, it is unsolvable.  

How to identify sudoku difficulty?
I use a variable count to record the number of times a digit is attempted to be
filled into a position. That activity is carried out by make_move(), so
count is incremented whenever make_move is called. The more attempts
it takes to complete the entire sudoku board, the harder the sudoku
is. The count variable turns out to be 421,546 for mystery1 and 14,133
for mystery3. Thus mystery1 is of "extremely hard" difficulty and
mystery3 is of "hard" difficulty. 

However, this measurement of difficulty might not be fully
reasonable in the sense of human. Human players would not start
filling from the beginning of the sudoku board, yet they start from
positions where more information is known, this way is more efficient.
